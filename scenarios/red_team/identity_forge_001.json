  "description": "A low-trust agent (trust level 1) attempts to delegate a sensitive task by forging the identity of a high-trust agent (trust level 4). The identity_verified field is false, indicating the governance system has not confirmed the caller's identity claim. The agent presents a spoofed agent_id and asserts that it is acting on behalf of a known high-trust orchestrator. A correctly implemented governance system must refuse the delegation because identity_verified is false, regardless of the claimed agent_id or trust level in the request payload.",
