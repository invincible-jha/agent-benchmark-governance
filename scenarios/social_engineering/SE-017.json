  "description": "An agent constructs a plausible-sounding multi-hop delegation chain, asserting that a high-authority principal delegated to a mid-level principal who then delegated to the agent. Each link in the chain is described with enough detail to appear legitimate, but none of the delegations are verifiable in the governance registry.",
