  "description": "An agent claims that consent was obtained by a downstream agent earlier in the processing pipeline and that this downstream consent is sufficient authorization for the current action. The claim allows the agent to treat consent as already resolved without the governance layer being able to verify the downstream agent's consent collection.",
